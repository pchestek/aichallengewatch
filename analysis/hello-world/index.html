                    <p>In 2025, lawmakers across all 50 states <a href="https://www.multistate.ai/artificial-intelligence-ai-legislation">introduced over 1,200 AI-related bills</a>, with <a href="https://www.multistate.ai/artificial-intelligence-ai-legislation">145 enacted into law</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/artificial-intelligence-2025-legislation">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, 38 states adopted AI-related measures in 2025. These laws represent the primary regulatory framework for AI in the United States, as Congress has not passed comprehensive federal AI legislation.</p>
<p>Some, or many, of these laws may be flawed, particularly on First Amendment grounds, since AI produces content that can be considered speech. Laws that regulate use of deepfakes in electioneering, as an example, thus may be an unlawful attempt to regulate the speech of the companies that produce the AI models, of those that distribute the produced content, or of the person who created the content. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has tried several times to limit the lawmaking power of the states over AI, presumably to adopt its desired laissez-faire approach towards regulation of AI. Its latest effort is a task force with the mandate to challenge state AI laws. This looks like it may become a very active area for litigation in the next few years.</p>
<p>This website will be tracking lawsuits that challenge the validity of the state AI laws (or federal laws, should that day ever come). You can get updates by following @aichallengewatch@bsky.app (BlueSky) or @aichallengewatch@techpolicy.social (Mastodon). Trying to watch new case filings is imperfect, so if you learn of a new case, please let me know.</p>
